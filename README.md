# Paint Calculator Bot

## Description

### ATTENTION!
- _**This is my first big project. Iâ€™m still learning how to structure and write code properly. Any suggestions, improvements, or advice are very welcome!**_

### What it does
- _**This is just a bot that calculates paint for you. Bot includes only multiplication.**_

### Note
- _**This program is not deployed on servers you will not be able to use on the network, but you can freely use my code for your needs.**_

## Libraries
This project uses the library introduced on the [Telegram website](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples#java).  
You can find more information about this library [here](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots).

### How to import library?

1. Using Maven Central Repository
```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.telegram</groupId>
        <artifactId>telegrambots</artifactId>
        <version>6.9.7.1</version>
    </dependency>
```
2. Using Gradle:

```gradle
    implementation 'org.telegram:telegrambots:6.9.7.1'
```

3. Download the jar(including all dependencies) from [right here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.telegram/telegrambots/6.9.7.1)

Import the library *.jar* directly to your project. Depending on the IDE you are using, the process to add a library
is different, here is a video that may help with [Intellij](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZaH4tjwMYg) or
[Eclipse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWnfHkBgO1I)

## Compile and Run

if this project interests you and you'd like to try it out:

1. clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MaxFashion322/paint-calculator-bot.git 
```

2. You must enter the token you received from the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)  
   in the `Bot` class in the `getBotToken()` method.
3. You must enter the username of your bot without '@' in the `CalculatorBot` class in the `getBotUsername()` method.
4. Install [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads) or later.
5. Install [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
6. Build the project:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

Maven will read the `pom.xml` and download all dependencies automatically then gives you a jar file named
`calculator-telegram-bot-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

7. Run this jar file and enjoy:
```shell
java -jar paint-calculator-bot-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

## Technical details

### Chapter 1. || Flow(`logic`) ||
_This is the main logic that shows how the bot works._  
_After this chapter you will find more detailed information about classes/methods._

1. User sends message to Telegram Bot.
2. Message gets into method `onUpdateReceived` class of **Bot**.  
2.1 `onUpdateReceived` is necessary because every time your bot receives any **information** it needs to be processed.
3. Inside this method we have another method that does everything it's `handleMessage()`.
4. The method calls(_I'll give small piece of information about each thing that it does_):  

**Every method will go almost one after the other**
- `startCommandReceived()` - is used to greet user when **'/start'** is given.  
**e.g.**  
_Welcome to Paint Calculator bot!_  
_This bot is for help with calculating paint for the house, use it in good health!_  


- `sendMessage()` - then you see different text because of this function.  
Basically `sendMessage` is `System.out.println()`, it allows you to send any text to the user, so it's very important.  
But you use it inside Telegram API, **not for console**!   
**e.g.**  
_Let's start calculating!_  
_Firstly, please enter the amount of rooms you would paint:_ 


- `isInputLegit()` - there is method that is included in every step (_I now realize that it'd require a whole class to check the input, but I'll improve it in the future._).
This is the second **important method** I got, because I knew that user couldn't just **break my app**, and it's a kind of check for the legitimacy of the message.
Well, for now the user still can destroy the program, if he writes just **_letters_**, but we will come back to this later in the **_Classes_** chapter.
```
    public boolean isInputLegit(Long userId, double value,
                                String negativeMsg, String zeroMsg,
                                boolean removeSession, boolean ifRoomIsZero,
                                boolean mustBeInteger, UserSession session) {
        if (value < 0){                                              
            sendMessage(userId, negativeMsg);
            if (removeSession) {
                sessions.remove(userId);
            }
            return false;
        }
        if (value == 0){
            sendMessage(userId, zeroMsg);
            if (removeSession) {
                sessions.remove(userId);
            }
            if(ifRoomIsZero){
                finishRoom(session, userId);
            }
            return false;
        }
        if (mustBeInteger && value % 1 != 0){
            sendMessage(userId, "Please enter a whole number!");
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```
_Then we have three methods that execute the most work._
- `finishRoom()` - this method creates the **room** and calculates all the paint user needs.  
Inside the `if` statement we have a condition that checks if the **room index** is less than the amount of rooms.
And if everything is fine, then we continue to the last **room**, but if this is it, then we write a **whole** amount of paint.
```
    public void finishRoom(UserSession session, Long userId) {
        Room room = new Room(new ArrayList<>(session.currentRoomWalls));
        session.rooms.add(room);

        session.currentRoomIndex++;
        if (session.currentRoomIndex < session.roomQty) {
            session.currentWallIndex = 0;
            session.currentRoomWalls.clear();
            session.currentStep = "ASK_WALL_QTY";
            sendMessage(userId, "Room #" + (session.currentRoomIndex + 1)
                    + "\n" + "Enter the amount of walls you would paint: ");
        } else {
            double totalPaint = 0;
            for (Room rooms : session.rooms) {
                totalPaint += rooms.getTotalPaint();
            }
            sendMessage(userId, "Total paint needed: " + Math.ceil(totalPaint) + " liters." +
                    "\n" + "\n" + " use " + "'/start' again, if you want to :).");
        }
    }

```
`currentRoomIndex` - this counter is necessary to keep in mind, which step was it _(1 or 7596789578)._

`roomQty` - the number of rooms we got from the **user's** request.

- `finishWall()` - this method needs to calculate amount of walls very similar to `finishRoom()`, but _walls =/._  
There is interesting thing, if user writes '0' or rooms are finished, then we get completed **room.**
```    
public void finishWall(UserSession session, Long userId) {
        Wall wall = session.buildWall();
        session.currentRoomWalls.add(wall);
        session.currentWallIndex++;

        if (session.currentWallIndex < session.wallQty) {
            session.currentStep = "ASK_HEIGHT";
            sendMessage(userId, "Wall #" + (session.currentWallIndex + 1) + "\n" +
                    "Enter the height of the wall:");
        } else
            finishRoom(session, userId);

        // Clear data
        session.holes.clear();
        session.holeQty = 0;
        session.currentHoleIndex = 0;
    }
```
`currentWallIndex` and `wallQty` - work the same as described above with `currentRoomIndex`,`roomQty`.  
_For `finishHole` I used variables in the same way._

- `finishHole()` - yes, I named it _holes_, for example we have a window, and it's basically a **rectangular hole,** 
or maybe I just see things as holes...(_and I didn't want to have a lot of figures, you can fix it under you._)
```
    public void finishHole(UserSession session, Long userId) {
        session.currentHoleIndex++;
        if (session.currentHoleIndex < session.holeQty) {
            session.currentStep = "ASK_HOLE_TYPE";
            sendMessage(userId, "Enter the type of the #" + (session.currentHoleIndex + 1) +
                    " hole" + " ('1' if circle / '2' if triangle / '3' if rectangle):");
        } else
            finishWall(session, userId);
    }
```

- `parseInput()` - the last method for safely converting text to number. The thing is that you shouldn't 
**return** `null`, because you can't control it and this might be very bad for your application.
```
    public Optional<Double> parseInput(String text) {
        try {
            double value = Double.parseDouble(text);
            return Optional.of(value);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }
    }
```
Instead of returning `null`, `Optional` is used, which makes the result predictable:
- If the input is correct â†’ `Optional.of(value)` is returned.
- If the input is invalid â†’ `Optional.empty()` is returned.

_**And now you see how the logic works, now let's talk about `Classes`**._
 
### Chapter 2. || Classes ||
**_I prefer the same structure, which we used with methods, so I'll explain every class one
after the other._**

- `UserSession` - is used to spectate user's **current** step.
```
public class UserSession {
    public String currentStep = "ASK_ROOM_QTY";
    public double roomQty;
    public double wallQty;
    public int currentRoomIndex;
    public int currentWallIndex;
    public List<Room> rooms = new ArrayList<>();
    public List<Wall> currentRoomWalls = new ArrayList<>();

    public double height;
    public double length;
    public double layers;
    public double consumption;
    public double holeQty;
    public int currentHoleIndex = 0;
    public double tempParam1;
    public double tempParam2;
    public List<Hole> holes = new ArrayList<>();

    public Wall buildWall(){
        return new Wall(height,length,layers,consumption,holes);
    }
}
```
`buildWall()` - we need this method to build the wall taking into account each parameter.

- `Optional<Double>maybeValue` - So, remember what I said about `isInputLegit`? The thing is,  
with **letters**, now thanks to `Optional`we can control this moment. You can exclude the writing of letters!  
Like this:
```
Optional<Double>maybeValue = parseInput(text);
if (maybeValue.isEmpty()){
    sendMessage(userId, "Please enter valid number!");
    return;
}
double value = maybeValue.get();
```

- `HoleFactory` - this is abstract class we have special quantity of figures, so it's better to give  
them all at least one function `createHole`.
```
public abstract class HoleFactory {
    public abstract Hole createHole();
}
```

_Now we will go inside each factory and even more into figures!_

- `CircleFactory`, `TriangleFactory`, `RectangleFactory` - these classes are created using the **Factory Pattern.**  
I find it easier to create shapes by sticking to a structure. 
```
public class CircleFactory extends HoleFactory{
    private final double radius;

    public CircleFactory(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public Hole createHole() {
        return new Circle(radius);
    }
}

public class RectangleFactory extends HoleFactory{
    private final double height;
    private final double length;

    public RectangleFactory(double _height,double _length) {
        height = _height;
        length = _length;
    }

    public Hole createHole(){
        return new Rectangle(height, length);
    }
}

public class TriangleFactory extends HoleFactory{
    private final double base;
    private final double height;

    public TriangleFactory(double _base, double _height) {
        base = _base;
        height = _height;
    }

    public Hole createHole(){
        return new Triangle(base, height);
    }
}
```

- `Circle`, `Triangle`, `Rectangle` -  Due to previous `Factory` classes we can make such shapes with all  
parameters.

```
public class Circle extends Hole {
    private final double radius;

    public Circle(double _radius){
        radius=_radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea(){
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle extends Hole {
    private final double height;
    private final double length;

    public Rectangle(double _height,double _length){
        height=_height;
        length=_length;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea(){
        return height*length;
    }
}

public class Triangle extends Hole{
    private final double base;
    private final double height;

    public Triangle(double _base,double _height){
        base = _base;
        height = _height;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea(){
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
}
```

`getArea()` - this method provides a formula for each shape.

- `Hole` - abstract class that gives our descendants a method like `getArea()`.

```
public abstract class Hole {
    public abstract double getArea();
}
```

- `Wall` - inherits from Rectangle and describes one wall of the room. Stores 
the number of layers of paint (layers), paint consumption per mÂ² (consumption) 
and a list of holes (holes) - windows, doors and other exceptions to the area.

```
public class Wall extends Rectangle {
    private final double layers;
    private final double consumption;
    private final List<Hole> holes;

    public Wall(double _height, double _length, double _layers, double _consumption, List<Hole> _holes) {
        super(_height,_length);
        layers=_layers;
        consumption=_consumption;
        holes = _holes;
    }

    public double getTotalSq(){
        double total = getArea();
        for(Hole hole:holes){
            total-=hole.getArea();
        }
        return Math.max(0,total);
    }

    public double getTotalConsumption(){
        return getTotalSq() * layers * consumption;
    }
}
```
`getTotalSq()` - method calculates the total area of the wall, excluding all holes.

`getTotalConsumption` - method returns how much paint is needed for this wall,
taking into account the area, layers and consumption.


- `Room` - combines several Wall objects into a single entity. Stores a list of walls.

```
public class Room {
    public ArrayList<Wall> walls = new ArrayList<>();

    public Room(ArrayList<Wall> _walls) {
        walls=_walls;
    }

    public Room(){}

    public double getTotalPaint(){
        double total=0;
        for(Wall w:walls){
            total+=w.getTotalConsumption();
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

`getTotalPaint()` - method sums up the paint consumption for all the walls of 
the room, giving the total result for the room.

- `Main` - just to start everything. In principle, you don't need it, but I used. 

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws TelegramApiException {
        TelegramBotsApi botsApi = new TelegramBotsApi(DefaultBotSession.class);
        Bot bot = new Bot();
        botsApi.registerBot(bot);
    }
}
```
_This is it with classes, now I wanted to conclude my project._

### Chapter 3. || Conclusion ||
#### _**For now, I've been doing this project for couple of months and it was tough.**_
#### _**While making, I noticed plenty of code that could've been improved. I'll make**_
#### _**an update in the future plan to improve the input validation, refactor**_
#### _**some parts of the logic, but for now it's going to be offline, because I'd like**_
#### _**to try something new.**_
